## About Me
Hi! I'm Lythe! While I have the most experience in WebDev and SysOps (Including full manual server setup from iso & proper hardening following the CRYPTREC recommendations.) I'm getting my paws more into system-development and low-level programming.
Also for most personal project I mainly use a propreitary version control instead of github so you may see some delays in my commits here, I mostly use github to collaborate with other users and show some of my programs to a wider audience.
